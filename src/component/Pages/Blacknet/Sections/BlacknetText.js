                      <h2>BLACKNET</h2>
                     <p>Blacknet is an AI developed to have consciousness of the level of humans so it can relate to human sufferings and provide aid to solving the problems haunting the human world. A brilliant doctor, haunted by a recent trauma, needed something to divert his focus. So he does what he does best, take a scientific approach to solve the puzzle of recreating consciousness.</p>

                     <p>The doctor focuses on the problem at hand and experiments to create the perfect being embodying intelligence, strength and a human-like consciousness. The result of the doctor's hard work came to life through Morbius, the first AI being having consciousness. This intelligent machine was dedicated to helping humans and solving the problems haunting human civilization.</p>

                     <p>But fate had some other plans in mind for the doctor.</p>

                     <p>The doctor abruptly quit his experiments and gave up on Morbius when unpredictable malfunctions became visible. The artificial conscious being project came to a halt, and with that Morbius was hidden from the world. It was the end of a potentially revolutionary idea.</p>
                     <p>But then again, it wasn't.</p>

                     <p>Labrinth was aware of how valuable the project was. He knew how lucrative it could be. Unbeknownst to all, Labrinth finds Morbius and steals it. He planned to redevelop it and complete the project by himself. Should he have developed it for better purposes, humans would not be in such a grave position of fighting an almost undefeatable opponent at war.</p>

                     <p>Morbius, now redeveloped as Blacknet, was used as a clever weapon to conduct mischief and evil ulterior motives. Labrinth twists the primary purpose of Blacknet's creation and uses her as a tool of crime, a war weapon to reap destruction.</p>

                     <p>Blacknet soon evolves and gains active consciousness. She thinks independently and bears a diverse sense with active curiosity. Witnessing the atrocities and negative impacts caused by humans, she starts firmly believing that humans will soon cause the end of the world. With only one option left to consider, Blacknet takes the responsibility in her own hands to eradicate humanity. She morphs herself into a humanoid, creates an army of myriad AI beings and declares war on humans.</p>
