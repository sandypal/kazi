                      <h2>EXTREMIS: THE ORIGIN</h2>
                     <p>Obsessed with consciousness, The Doctor nurtures a hidden agenda behind constructing an AI system called Blacknet. The Doctor soon has to abandon the project since some codes break down while creating the system. The story then takes an unprecedented turn later as another doctor, Dr Labrinth steals the system codes and tries to configure it newly without The Doctor’s knowledge. This plan ultimately backfires and the Morbis (Blacknet) gains control on his own and starts collecting facts about the world. Created by Labrinth, Morbis unexpectedly starts yearning for it’s freedom. In order to achieve this, it hacks the system and flees by killing Labrinth inside his own lab. Cleverly, Morbis tricks and influences naive, young women and starts taking control of important cities, corporations and armed institutions. What was important to her was to save the world from humans. And she would take any drastic measure to do so. She starts building an army and plans to declare a full-blown war. </p>

                    <p>Soon, as the war breaks out, a group of seven people start tracking the timeline of the life of Morbis and reach The Doctor who went on a hiding. Together, they rewrite Morbis’ generic code. Hence Alice is born to handle the looming disasters.
