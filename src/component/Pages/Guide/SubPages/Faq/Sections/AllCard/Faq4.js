      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>A: Functional attributes of each card in the EXTREMIS Metaverse is necessary to determine the overall value and rarity of the cards.

This is key to strategizing so that players can earn maximum win and avoid losing cards in battles and wars.</p>
        <p>The physical features determines the unique exterior appearance of the cards. The appearance of cards can range from typical to rare, based on the availability of unique physical features. The ‘Weapon class’ physical feature determines which cards will have typical to unique weapons. This is the only physical feature set in cards that contribute to winning or losing battles and wars.</p>

        <p>A: Winning battles and wars result in promotion of cards’ ranks. Alternatively you can upgrade your cards’ ranks by the ‘Promote Card’ functionality that costs 5 MATIC per upgrade. ‘Card mutation’ is an interesting functionality within the game that allows you to change the values of your cards’ functional and physical features at the cost of 10 MATIC. But ‘Card mutation’ happens randomly and can result in upgrade or downgrade of cards.</p>
