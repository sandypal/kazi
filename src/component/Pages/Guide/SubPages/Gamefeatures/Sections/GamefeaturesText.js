         <h3>Purchase cards</h3>
         <p>After signing up and setting up your profile, purchase your first card through the EXTREMIS ‘Marketplace’ or ‘Auction house’ to begin playing. Browse through all the cards on sale. You can buy any cards at a fixed rate in the ‘Marketplace’. Whereas the ’Auction house’ enables you to bid on cards. The highest bidder gets the card. You can start with only one card in your collection. But you may also buy multiple cards to advance in the game more strategically.</p>

         <h3>Breed cards</h3>
         <p>Players can breed their cards to make newer cards with a variety of attribute values and feature rarity. New cards also grow your collection thus enabling you to sell cards in the future or enlist them for combat. The users are allowed to breed cards within their collection or other players’ cards as well. However, breeding is only allowed between cards of the same faction. In case of Human, players can only breed between opposite genders.</p>
